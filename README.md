GG Bro is an interactive way for twitch followers to donate to their favorite streamers! With just a simple click you can throw emojis for Twitch Bits onto the screen with fun sounds and animations go along with it. 

What are Twitch Bits?

Twitch Bits are effectively mini-donations from viewers. They pay for them using either Amazon Payments or PayPal. Bits are a type of virtual currency that gamers can ‚Äúspend‚Äù on their favorite gamers‚Äô sites. Twitch pays their Affiliates and Partners one cent for every Bit fans use on their channels.
